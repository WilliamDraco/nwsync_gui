# nwsync_gui
An unofficial multi-platform gui for https://github.com/Beamdog/nwsync

A gui written in nim in order to construct and communicate the command-line arguements for the use of nwsync.

Use:

1) Download nwsync itself.
2) Download the nwsync_gui binary from the releases tab, or clone-and-build yourself.
3) Run it
4) Choose a Source file (currently only supports a single-file, such as a .mod)
5) Choose the Destination folder (the serving folder of your http server)
6) Hit the "NWSync Write" button, and wait for it to finish.


Please note that the gui platform for nim is in a beta stage and oddities may occur. I'll do my best to resolve them as I'm made aware but options are limited.
